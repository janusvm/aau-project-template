## incl/pre

The `incl/pre` folder contains the modularised preamble;

  * `incl/pre/pkgs.tex` loads all the packages used
  * `incl/pre/cmds.tex` defines custom commands and environments
  * `incl/pre/conf.tex` holds various configurations
  * `incl/pre/ext/` is a folder for bundled, external code (i.e. LaTeX macros authored by someone else which isn't available as a package in the usual TeX distributions)
