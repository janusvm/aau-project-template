## incl/misc

The `incl/misc` folder is for formalities and other content that is not counted as main content or appendices:

- `abstract.tex` contains the abstract, a short summary of the document
- `contents.tex` contains commands for generating the table of contents and various lists of objects
- `frontpage.tex` generates the front page
- `titlepage.tex` generates the title page

Note that `frontpage.tex` and `titlepage.tex` only need to be edited if you want to make changes to the layouts; the contents are automatically generated from the variables in the top of `master.tex`.
