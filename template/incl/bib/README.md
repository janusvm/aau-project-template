## incl/bib

The `incl/bib` folder is for `.bib` files, which are used by BibTeX to generate citations.
Each entry is given a key which can be used to insert citations in the document using the command `\citep`.

A section with the bibliography is automatically generated with all the _cited_ references.
Entries in the `.bib` files that are not cited in the document do not get included in the bibliography list.

See <https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Bibliography_Management#BibTeX> for details.
