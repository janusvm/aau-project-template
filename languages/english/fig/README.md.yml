  title: "Why have seperate files for this?"
  body:
    - line: "While you can certainly just put the code for creating e.g. a table directly in the main files, putting that kind of content in its own file makes the document more modular and easier to maintain and edit."
    - line: ""
    - line: "Having all the LaTeX code for generating a floating object in its own file makes it easy to move it around the document or commented out for debugging."
    - line: "It also makes it easier to keep track of changes made to a particular figure through the git commit history."
