% The 'book' class is the document class with the most flexible options.

% The bundled 'macros' file defines commands for creating an AAU style title
% page (this would usually go in the preamble, but since these macros are
% authored by someone else, I have kept them seperate from mine).
\input{incl/misc/macros}

% The 'preamble' is all the stuff that goes before actual document contents. The
% \input command is equivalent to copying and pasting the contents from the file
% into the point where the command is called.
\input{preamble}

% All contents of the document go between the \begin and \end commands for the
% 'document' environment.
\begin{document}

% The front matter is not counted in the numbered pages and are instead numbered
% with roman numerals. This consists of, for example, the front page, title
% page, preface, and table of contents.
\frontmatter
\include{incl/misc/frontpage}
\include{incl/misc/titlepage}

% Automatic table of contents based on the heading structure of the input files.
\tableofcontents

% The main matter is were the bulk of your work goes. Pages and headings have
% arabic numbers.
\mainmatter

% Input files should be partitioned such that each file corresponds to one
% chapter.  The \include command forces a page break and inserts the contents of
% the input file.
