This document serves as a \LaTeX{} project template for first year students at Aalborg University, Dept. of Mathematics.

Examples of some common commands and environments are given to showcase their intended use.

The template can be used as-is, with students only having to write the actual contents, but interested students are encouraged to use the template as inspiration for their own customisations.
