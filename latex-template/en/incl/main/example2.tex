Here is another example input file.

\section{Custom Environments and Commands}
\label{sec:custom}

While \LaTeX{} provides commands for many different purposes, you will often find yourself defining your own.
For this template, I have included some examples of custom environments and commands in the preamble (\texttt{premable.tex}).

Such commands can save you a lot of typing when working on a long, modular document such as a semester project.
For instance, instead of typing \verb!\mathbb{N}! every time you want the symbol for the set of natural numbers, define a shorter command, like \verb!\N!.
The syntax for defining commands is as follows:
%
\begin{verbatim}
\newcommand{name}[num]{definition}
\end{verbatim}
%
where \texttt{name} is the command name, e.g. \verb!\N!, \texttt{num} is the number of arguments the command takes (omit the square brackets if the command takes no arguments), and \texttt{definition} is the output of the command, e.g. \verb!\mathbb{N}!.


\subsection{Definitions, Theorems, Proofs}
\label{sec:thms}

In a mathematics project, you are going to be including mathematical definitions, propositions, lemmas, theorems, etc.
The \texttt{amsthm} package provides a simple way to define such environments:
%
\begin{verbatim}
\newtheorem{name}{Printed output}[numberby]
\end{verbatim}
%
A few examples are included in the preamble.
See \url{https://en.wikibooks.org/wiki/LaTeX/Theorems} for more information.

\begin{defn}[Rational numbers]
  A real number \(r\) is called \emph{rational} if there exist integers \(p\) and \(q\) with \(q \neq 0\) such that \(r = p/q\)
  (a real number which is not rational is called \emph{irrational}).
  The set of rational numbers is denoted with \(\Q\).
\end{defn}
%
\begin{thm}[Example of Named Theorem]
  \(\sqrt{2}\) is irrational.
\end{thm}
%
\begin{proof}
  Suppose \(\sqrt{2} \in \Q\) and let \(k = \min\{\, N \in \N : N\sqrt{2} \in \N \,\}\).
  But then \(k (\sqrt{2} - 1) = (k\sqrt{2} - k) \in \N\), and \(k(\sqrt{2} - 1) < k\), which is a contradiction.
  Therefore, \(\sqrt{2} \notin \Q\).
\end{proof}


\section{Citations}
\label{sec:citations}

When you use other people's work, you must cite them.
Citations in \LaTeX{} is usually handled with BibTeX, a procedure that identifies resources from a bibliography file you provide.
Literature resources must be defined in a \texttt{.bib} file and included with the \verb!bibliography! command.
Each entry in this file must have a resource type and a key to identify it by.
The syntax for citing a resource is
%
\begin{verbatim}
\citep[scope]{bibkey}
\end{verbatim}
%
where \texttt{bibkey} is the unique identifier you give the resource in the \texttt{.bib} file, and \texttt{scope} can be used to refer to a specific chapter or range of pages.

When you cite a resource, that resource is automatically added to the literature list, and in the PDF file the citations become clickable links pointing to that list.
For example, by citing \citep[pp. 104-110]{edpenn}, an entry for it is added to the bibliography on the last page.

There are several different types of BibTeX entries, and each type has its own set of mandatory and optional fields.
